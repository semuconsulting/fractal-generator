# Fractal Generator - How to contribute

**fractal-generator** is an open source volunteer project and we appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing new functionality. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

Being one of our contributors, you agree and confirm that:

* The work is all your own.
* Your work will be distributed under a BSD 3-Clause License once your pull request is merged.
* You submitted work fulfils or mostly fulfils our coding conventions, styles and standards.

Please help us keep our issue list small by adding fixes: #{$ISSUE_NO} to the commit message of pull requests that resolve open issues. GitHub will use this tag to auto close the issue when the PR is merged.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to fractal-generator](https://github.com/Algol-Variables/fractal-generator/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (above) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."



Thanks,
